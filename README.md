# LIBRARY
Organising all the reusable code for future references.

# Structure
Relevant functions are organised into scripts. Each section within a script is organised as two part: functions and a simple example. 

Each section of the scripts represent a small task, and should be started with a one-line header stating the task. 

# Note
No efforts is made to formally package the code, though relevant comments are kept to provide context. The goal of this LIBRARY is organising existing code (mostly from data analysis scripts) for future references. Important code should be packaged and should not be simply listed here.
